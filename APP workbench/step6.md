To build a custom CentOS 6.x base image:

1.SSH into the system where App Workbench is installed.

2.Create a directory by executing the mkdir command, such as:

$> mkdir -p ~/src/base_images.

3.Switch to the directory you just created by executing the cd command, such as:

$> cd ~/src/base_images.

4.Retrieve the BlueData base image for CentOS 6 by executing the following command:

$> bdwb --baseimg centos6.

5.This creates a directory called centos6 under your current directory.

6.Switch to the centos6 directory by executing the following command:

$> cd centos6

$> ls -a

7.You may override one or more of the following parameter(s) by executing the following command(s), as appropriate:

$> export BASE_IMG_ORGNAME='<orgname>', where <orgname> is the name of your organization, such as enterprise. The default name is bluedata.
  
$> export BASE_IMG_VERSION
  
$> export CENTOS6_UPSTREAM='<upstream>', where <upstream> is the name of the upstream image source, such as 
  
 artifactory.com/enterprise:centos6. The default upstream image source is centos:centos6.
 
8.Modify the base image as needed. See HelloWorld Application Image Walkthrough for an example of creating a custom image.

9.Make the new image by executing the following command:

$> make centos6

10.Verify that the image has built successfully by executing the command $> docker images.
