Let's Start App workbench Tutorial 

App Workbench â€“ A tool provided by BlueData to create, assemble, and share dockerized applications running on BlueData

App Workbench version 3.4 (also called bdwb) is a Python-based CLI framework that provides a rich set of APIs, macros, and a shell to:
<ul>
  <li>Create Docker images from Dockerfiles based on BlueData images.</li>
  <li>Orchestrate the run time environment for single and multi-node deployments.</li>
  <li>Package and load images into the BlueData EPIC App Store</li>
</ul>

The App Workbench focuses mainly on the following three use cases:
<ul>
  <li>Modify or upgrade an existing Hadoop or Spark distribution in the App Store</li>
  <li>Add a new application as an edge node to a Hadoop or Spark cluster with auto-provisioning</li>
  <li>Create new images for Big Data applications and frameworks</li>
</ul>

New features in App Workbench 3.4:
<ul>
  <li>Assign a different Docker image to each virtual node role</li>
  <li>Auto-increment build numbers</li>
  <li>Variable definition</li>
  <li>Role-specific options</li>
  <li>Remote copy/execute</li>
  <li>Remote Docker registries</li>
</ul>
