Lets Copy the image file to our working directory<br>

<br>When our image is ready to deploy in the EPIC Application Catalog, we need to include a picture that represents the image. For your reference, we have already created a .png file for your use.
<br>`cp ~/test/Logo_HortonWorks.png ~/HDP`{{execute}}<br>
<br><b>Logo.png file</b> includes a logo file (400px x 200px .png) to visually identify each application in the App Store
