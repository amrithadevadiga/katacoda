<b>App Catalog â€“ Node, Role, and Service</b>

BlueData catalog allows users to map a deployment strategy in a json file, and use this json as a guide while stating the cluster. Same Docker image can be used in multiple strategies. 
<br>Catalog file includes:
<br>
<br>Node - A running docker container instance. A cluster can have several nodes, spread on several physical hosts
<br>
<br>Role - A type of a container.  Example: worker, master, edge, etc. A cluster can have zero or more containers of each role after deployment
<br>
<br>Service - A list of all possible services registered for a given cluster. Example: CM Server, CM Agent.NameNode, DataNode, Yarn RM, NodeManager, Hive Thrift Sever, 
<br>
<br>Role to Service mapping -  Defining the association of what list of services run on which role. Example: NameNode and Yarn RM runs on master. DataNode and NodeManager runs on worker.
